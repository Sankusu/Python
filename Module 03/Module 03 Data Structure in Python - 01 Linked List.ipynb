    "# Linked List\n",
    "In its most basic form, a linked list is a string of nodes, sort of like a string of pearls, with each node containing both data and a reference to the next node in the list (Note: This is a singly linked list. The nodes in a doubly linked list will contain references to both the next node and the previous node). The main advantage of using a linked list over a similar data structure, like the static array, is the linked list's dynamic memory allocation: if you don't know the amount of data you want to store before hand, the linked list can adjust on the fly. Of course this advantage comes at a price: dynamic memory allocation requires more space and commands slower look up times.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Linked List, it is important to explicitly specify the location of the first item. Once it is known where the first item is, the first item can tell us where the second is, and so on. The external reference is often referred to as the head of the list. Similarly, the last item needs to know that there is no next item."

The `while` loop actually implements the traversal. As long as the current reference has not seen the end of the list (`None`), we move current along to the next node via the assignment statement `current = current.getNext()`. Every time current moves to a new node, we add 1 to `count`. Finally, count gets returned after the iteration stops.\n",
