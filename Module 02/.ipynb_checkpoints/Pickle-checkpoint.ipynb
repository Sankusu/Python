    "## Introduction\n",
    "Literally, the term pickle means storing something in a saline solution. Only here, instead of vegetables its objects. Not everything in life can be seen as 0s and 1s (gosh! philosophy), but pickling helps us achieve that since it converts any kind of complex data to 0s and 1s (byte streams). This process can be referred to as pickling, serialization, flattening or marshalling. The resulting byte stream can also be converted back into Python objects by a process known as Unpickling."

    "## Why Pickle?\n",
    "Since we are dealing with binary, the data is not written but dumped and similarly, the data is not read, it is loaded. For example, when you play a game like 'Dave' and you reach a certain level, you would want to save it right? As you know there are various attributes to this game like, health, gems collected etc. So when you save your game, say at level 7 when you have one heart for health and thirty hundred points, an object is created from a class Dave with these values. When you click the 'Save' button, this object is serialized and saved or in other words pickled. Needless to say, when you restore a saved game, you will be loading data from its pickled state thus unpickling it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The real world uses of Pickling and Unpickling are widespread as they allow you to easily send data from one server to another, and store it in a file or database."

    "**WARNING:**\n",
    "Never unpickle data received from an untrusted source as this may pose some serious security risks. The Pickle module is not capable of knowing or raising errors while pickling malicious data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pickling and Unpickling can be used only if the corresponding module Pickle is imported. You can do this by using the following command:"

    "### Advantages\n",
    "Helps in saving complicated data.\n",
    "Quite easy to use, doesnâ€™t require several lines of code and hence not bulky.\n",

    "Non-Python programs may not be able to reconstruct pickled Python objects.\n",
