    "Before starting to write programs, you ’ ll need to learn how to experiment with the Python shell. For now, you can think of the Python shell as a way to peer within running Python code. It places you inside of a running instance of Python, into which you can feed programming code; at the same time, Python will do what you have asked it to do and will show you a little bit about how it responds to its environment. Because running programs often have a context — things that you as the programmer have\n",
