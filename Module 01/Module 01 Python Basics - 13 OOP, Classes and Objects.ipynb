    "### Class\n",
    "A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Variable\n",
    "A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods. Class variables are not used as frequently as instance variables are.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Member\n",
    "A class variable or instance variable that holds data associated with a class and its objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Overloading\n",
    "The assignment of more than one behavior to a particular function. The operation performed varies by the types of objects or arguments involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instance Variable\n",
    "A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance\n",
    "The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are derived from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instance\n",
    "An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example, is an instance of the class Circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instantiation\n",
    "The creation of an instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method\n",
    "A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object\n",
    "A unique instance of a data structure that is defined by its class. An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operator Overloading\n",
    "The assignment of more than one function to a particular operator."

    "Different namespaces can co-exist at a given time but are completely isolated. A namespace containing all the built-in names is created when we start the Python interpreter and exists as long we don't exit. This is the reason that built-in functions like id(), print() etc. are always available to us from any part of the program. Each module creates its own global namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "These different namespaces are isolated. Hence, the same name that may exist in different modules do not collide. Modules can have various functions and classes. A local namespace is created when a function is called, which has all the names defined in it. Similar, is the case with class. "
